The client does not follow her investments and has been guided by previous advisers. She is
currently in Attivo's ongoing service paying 0.75% per year, and she is not convinced of the need for
a review and hasn't had one for 5 years.
The client has not reviewed holdings for many years and currently doesn't keep track of anything
other than the bottom line. The client has little understanding of investments but is keen to learn
more.
The client is looking to retire at 65 and wind up the architect business then. It has no intrinsic value,
only commissions in the past by word of mouth and reputation. Her income fluctuates each year but
on average she takes an income of £60,000 per year. Her accountant can provide more details if
needed.
• Would like to ensure she has pension income in retirement equal to her current salary
• Would like to help children onto property ladder in future, likely to be in next 5 to 10 years
• Client open to change but needs to be convinced of reasons
• Medium/High attitude to risk
• No large expenditure planned
• Some concerns around IHT and tax efficiency of current investments, and is keen to leave a
much of a legacy as possible to the children
• Unsure on whether she has sufficient monies to retire in 5 years based on the level of
income she is looking for
• Her mother is currently 87, and in poor health. Her father passed away 5 years ago. In the
event of her passing, Sarah is an only child and expects to inherit an estate worth up to £2m.
She has no idea whether her mother has spoken to an Adviser in respect of IHT, and doesn't
understand the implications of this
• She currently pays around £20,000 per year into her SIPP, although this can fluctuate
depending on her income
• One child is in their first year at university, staying in halls which the client pays for, the other
about to do GCSEs and wants to go to university after A levels.
• House is paid for and no plans to move. Would like to travel regularly to the Far East in
retirement for about a month at a time, Thailand Vietnam, Cambodia staying in nice hotels.
